# Megaline Statistical Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing user behavior and revenue performance of Megaline's prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The analysis aims to provide insights into which plan generates higher revenue and understand any behavioral differences between plan users based on call minutes, text messages, and internet usage.

## Description
The project utilizes a dataset containing information on 500 Megaline clients, including demographics, plan subscriptions, and usage data from 2018. The dataset will be cleaned and analyzed to identify patterns and differences in revenue generation and user behavior between the Surf and Ultimate plans.

## Objectives
- Analyze and clean the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
- Compare revenue performance between the Surf and Ultimate plans.
- Examine user behavior metrics (call minutes, text messages, internet usage) across plan types.
- Identify any significant differences in revenue and usage patterns to inform strategic decisions.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, we aim to determine which prepaid plan, Surf or Ultimate, yields higher revenue for Megaline. Additionally, we will assess if there are distinct behavioral differences between users of these plans. The findings will guide future decisions related to advertising budget allocation and plan offerings.

## Libraries
The project will utilize the following Python libraries:
- Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: for data visualization.
- NumPy: for numerical computations.
- SciPy: for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.
